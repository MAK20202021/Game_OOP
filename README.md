## Game_OOP

This project is a good example of Object-Oriented Programming. It provides the opportunities to create large modular program. It can be easily used for the future program. It facilitates the feature to change any attribute centrally. It can help to build a package for Pypi.

## Project Motivation:
To get the better idea about Object Oriented Programming, it is a better idea to create a simple game. I always like to play Tic Tac Toe game from my childhood. Therefore, I chose this simple game to get better understanding of class, objects, methods and attributes. 
This project will provide the platform for Tic Tac Toe game between two players. It checkes all the probabilities of winning the game. It checkes the tie also.
After completing one round it will ask whether the players want to play again. If it gets the affirmative response it will refresh the game board and
start the new game.
