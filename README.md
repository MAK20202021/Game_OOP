## Project Motivation
This project is for evaluating two data sets from Airbnb. One data set is for Boston in 2017 and another one is for Seattle in 2016. Evaluating these two data sets, we can answer the following questions:
- Evaluate the price comparison between Boston and Seattle airbnb during first half in a year?
- How the price varies depending on the square feet of the home for both cities?
- Does reviewer score depend on the price considering positive and negative reviews?
## File Description
All data for Boston and Seattle are provided. For each city, this project has three data sets related to calendar, listings and reviews.

## Discussion
After evaluating data from two cities, it is found that during first half of a year Boston airbnb price is high over Seattle airbnb. Depending on the square feet of the home the price varies. Seattle price is reasonable over Boston airbnb price, if anyone prefers more space in reasonnable price he or she can choose Seattle airbnb. Considering positive and negative reviews, it is found that in case of higher price for both cities reviewers provide positive reviews.
